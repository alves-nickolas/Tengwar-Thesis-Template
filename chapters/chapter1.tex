Let us also cite some references: \textcite{aguiaralves2023NonperturbativeAspectsQuantum,codello2010NovelFunctionalRenormalization,donoghue2012EffectiveFieldTheory,hawking1975ParticleCreationBlack,khavkine2015AlgebraicQFTCurved,wald1994QuantumFieldTheory,weinberg1995QuantumTheoryFieldsSeries}.

We can also discuss some abbreviations, such as \gls{qftcs}, \gls{gr}, and \gls{qg}. These abbreviations will only occur as abbreviations if we mention them twice in the same chapter. Otherwise, they will just be fully expanded. See: \gls{qftcs} and \gls{qg}.
